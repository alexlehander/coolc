### A compiler for the COOL language

This repository contains a compiler for the [COOL langauge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_(programming_language)).

Specifically the following compiler phases are implemented:
* Lexing
* Parsing
* Semantic analysis
* Optimization
* Code generation

The semantic analysis and optimization phases have a very limited scope.
